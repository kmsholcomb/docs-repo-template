.. Define |product name| in conf.py

Document any troubleshooting steps for any common issues related to the product
or service described in the user guide. The following text provides an
example of how you could present multiple sections.

If you encounter issues when working with |product name|, use the information
in this section to help you troubleshoot.

Section
~~~~~~~

Provide a descriptive heading for this section that begins with an imperative
verb. For example: Open TCP ports. Provide whatever information is appropriate
to the topic.

If your troubleshooting steps require a numbered procedure, list steps in
numbered order and limit each step to a single action. You can add additional
information related to a step in an indented paragraph. For example:

1. Open the **Run** window, type **cliconfig**, and ensure that the TCP/IP
protocol is enabled.

2. Verify that the SQL Server service is started.

   - *(SQL Server 2005, 2008, and 2008 R2)* Select
     **Start > Administrative Tools > Services**, and verify that the
     **SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER)** service is started.
   - *(SQL Server 2012, 2014, and 2016)* Use the Windows key or hover the mouse
     pointer over the lower-left corner of the desktop, select
     **Administrative Tools > Services**, and verify that the
     **SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER)** service is started.

3. Create more steps as needed.

Conclude with a brief description of the end state.
