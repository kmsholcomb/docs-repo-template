.. Define |product name| in conf.py

Provide information about the compatibility or integration of the product or
service with other Rackspace products or services or third-party products or
services. Following is an example.

|product name| might not be compatible with all Rackspace products and
services. Contact your Rackspace Support specialist for detailed information
about whether any specific Rackspace product is compatible with
|product name|.

Compatibility with third-party products
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can access |product name| by using the |product name| API. You can use any
third-party management, orchestration, or other type of tools that are
compatible with the |product name| API. The functionality of any such tool is
limited by the {product} features and capabilities as described in this user
guide. Ensure that the |product name| API version of your environment is
compatible with the third-party tools that you want to use.
